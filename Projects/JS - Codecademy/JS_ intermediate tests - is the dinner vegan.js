/*Write a function isTheDinnerVegan() that takes in an array of food objects in the format:

{name: 'cabbage', source: 'plant' }
and returns a boolean value based on whether or not every item in the array has entirely plant-based origins.

const meal = [{name: 'arugula', source: 'plant'}, {name: 'tomatoes', source: 'plant'}, {name: 'lemon', source:'plant'}, {name: 'olive oil', source: 'plant'}];

isTheDinnerVegan(meal); // Should return true
You can test your function when you're ready by passing in the dinner array or by making your own!*/
